4. Version Control Integration: It may integrate with version control systems like Git, enabling users to track changes, collaborate on documentation projects, and manage versioning effectively.
5. Automation: Pena Tools CLI may support automation of repetitive tasks related to documentation, such as generating tables of contents, updating links, or performing batch operations on documentation files.
6. Configuration Management: It could include commands for configuring settings, themes, styles, and other aspects of documentation appearance and behavior.
7. Build and Deployment: The CLI may have functionalities for building documentation sites and deploying them to various hosting platforms or environments.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides several features essential for building modern web applications. It offers server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing, making it a powerful choice for building robust and performant web applications.

## Benefits of Next.js for Documentation

### Static-site Generator (SSG)

A static site generator (SSG) is a tool or framework used to create static websites. Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on the server in response to user requests, static websites are pre-built and served as-is to users, making them faster and more efficient for certain types of content.

### Automatic Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles, allowing for faster page loads and better resource utilization.

### Simplified Routing

With Next.js, routing is simple and intuitive. You can define routes easily, making navigation within your documentation straightforward.

## How to Use Next.js in PenaTeam Documentation

### Setup and Installation

To start using Next.js in your documentation project:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
2. Create a new Next.js project using the command `npx create-next-app`.
3. Navigate to your project directory and start the development server with `npm run dev`.

### Creating Pages

Next.js uses a pages-based routing system. Create new pages in the `pages` directory, and Next.js will automatically handle the routing.

### Adding Components

Utilize React components to structure your documentation pages. Components can be reused across multiple pages, promoting consistency and efficiency.

### Styling

Next.js supports various styling options, including CSS Modules, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS. Choose the approach that best suits your needs for styling your documentation.

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful tool for building dynamic and efficient documentation websites. By leveraging its features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing, you can create a seamless and engaging experience for users accessing PenaTeam's documentation.

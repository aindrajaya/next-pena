## Overview

The architecture of our Next.js documentation is designed to provide a seamless browsing experience for users. It includes components for navigation, content rendering, routing, and styling.

## Components

Our documentation uses various components to structure and present information effectively. Key components include:

- Navbar: Provides navigation links for easy access to different sections.
- Sidebar: Displays a table of contents for quick navigation within a section.
- Content Area: Renders detailed information based on user selection.
- Footer: Includes useful links and information about the documentation.

## Routing

Next.js offers robust routing capabilities, allowing us to create dynamic pages and handle client-side navigation efficiently. Routing is configured based on the documentation structure to ensure a logical flow of content.

```jsx
// Example of dynamic routing in Next.js
import Link from 'next/link';

const Navigation = () => (
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/docs/getting-started">
          <a>Getting Started</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/docs/api-reference">
          <a>API Reference</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      {/* Add more links as needed */}
    </ul>
  </nav>
);
```

## Styling
Styling plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and usability of our documentation. We utilize Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling components.
```jsx
// Example of styling with Tailwind CSS in Next.js
import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    {children}
  </button>
);

export default Button;

```

## Code Samples
We include code samples throughout the documentation to demonstrate implementation details and best practices. These samples cover various aspects of using Next.js effectively.
```jsx
// Example of data fetching in Next.js
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const UserDetails = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { userId } = router.query;
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
      const userData = await response.json();
      setUser(userData);
    };

    if (userId) {
      fetchUser();
    }
  }, [userId]);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
      {/* Display other user details */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserDetails;

```
This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of our Next.js documentation architecture and how it enhances the user experience.

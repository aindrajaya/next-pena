## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install Pena app for your project:

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. And install the `create-pena-app-ext` cli.

```shell
npm install -g create-pena-app-ext
```

### Step 2: Create a New Pena app Project
To create a new Pena app project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-pena-app-ext@latest your-project
```
Replace my-next-app with the name you want to give to your project

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Navigate to your project directory using the following command:
```bash
cd your-project
```
Replace your-project with the name of your project directory.


### Step 4: Start the Development Server
To start the development server and see your Pena app project in action, run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000, where you can view your project.

### Step 5: Explore Pena Features

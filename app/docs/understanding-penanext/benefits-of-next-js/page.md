### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

One of the key advantages of Next.js is its built-in support for server-side rendering. This means that pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client, improving performance and SEO.

### Automatic Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles, allowing for faster page loads and better resource utilization.

### Simplified Routing

With Next.js, routing is simple and intuitive. You can define routes easily, making navigation within your documentation straightforward.

## How to Use Next.js in PenaTeam Documentation
---

### Setup and Installation

To start using Next.js in your documentation project:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
2. Create a new Next.js project using the command `npx create-next-app`.
3. Navigate to your project directory and start the development server with `npm run dev`.

### Creating Pages

Next.js uses a pages-based routing system. Create new pages in the `pages` directory, and Next.js will automatically handle the routing.

### Adding Components

Utilize React components to structure your documentation pages. Components can be reused across multiple pages, promoting consistency and efficiency.

### Styling

Next.js supports various styling options, including CSS Modules, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS. Choose the approach that best suits your needs for styling your documentation.
